A Frontend project that has helped me to practice the following skills:    
    1. Responsive designing   
        - CSS Media Queries  
        - Grid  
        - CSS Flexbox  
    2. Accessibility tools    
        - WAI-ARIA  
        - Appropriate HTML Semantics  
        - CSS and Javascript  
           


The application has been built using CSS, HTML5 and Vanilla Javascript.
